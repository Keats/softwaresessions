Hi, I'm Jeremy Jung. I've been doing this software development thing for a while now but I still have a lot to learn.  I think things are still harder than they should be.

I'm having conversations with folks to hear their practical experiences and stories.  I plan to make my guest's knowledge accessible with show notes, transcripts, and articles. It's too easy to forget something you only hear in audio form.

If this is helpful to you or you have any suggestions, please [let me know](mailto:contact@softwaresessions.com).
